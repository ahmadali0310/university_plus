            University Graduate of Pakistan in emerging Technologies of the 21st Century.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: black">
            To address the existing crisis in job markets for university graduates with a fast track strategy.
          </p>
          
          <br />
          <h4>Who Are We?</h4>
          <br />
          <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: black">Centre of information technology (CIT) the base organization of University Plus has a diversified experience of the
            last
            25 years as a recordable training Institute in different disciplines of ICTs and as a social responsibility invested
            its
            resources from E-Village “2009” to E-Pakistan”2020”. The above experience of CIT has given a vision to the existing
            team
            of university plus to now invest future leaders of Pakistan.
            CIT through its flagship E-Pakistan (www.e-pakistan.org) has outreach globally in many countries through its allied
            Organizations such as SDGs Academy (www.sdgsacademy.com.pk), IOT (www.iot-center.pk).
            Now! the dynamic team of the University is geared up to face the challenges from the front and to engage all relevant
            stakeholders like top-level Ph.D. doctors in their respective domains and industry experts having hands-on knowledge/
            right connections with the global market and to link them with our inspiring and forward youth of Pakistan.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>What we Do?</h4>
            <br />
            <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: black">The Fast-Digital Transformation and our growing dependence on it have already created gaps between traditional knowledge
            sets and the need for a knowledge economy. This gap is increasing fast and we need to think out of the box to bridge the
            gaps. The latest technologies and their easy adoption are also providing options to fill these gaps provided we
            proactively react to the market demands. Center of Information Technology ( CIT ) a Private Limited Company having plus
            25 years’ Experience in Education, IT Services & Solutions in Partnership with Our National & International Partners has
            conceived this idea of University Plus to fill these gaps and Start the Process of “ Preparing the Future Leaders of
            Pakistan to Meet the Challenges of 21st Century based on a Global Best Practices of knowledge Economy and Content of
            Emerging Technologies ( Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, AR/VR and 3D
            Technologies, etc. ) The following are the Main Reasons to Start the Project Immediately.<br />
            1) The pyramid of the education system needs to be revised immediately based on Global Best Practices as the bottom
            layer is divided into many levels of education ( In terms of Quality & Environments ) in the Same City & Locality.
            (English Medium, Urdu Medium, Madrasas, Village Schools, Open-air schools & informal arrangements for out of Schools,
            etc )<br />
            2) The entire system is based on traditional bookish knowledge with little investments in adopting new trends like K-12
            or STEM system which is very Focused to Improve the Creativity Process of the Students.<br />
            3) At the college level, very diversified fields in education are available having no defined channels / Counseling to
            Students to Join Upcoming new Fields having demands in Industry. The entire system is working on ‘ Go where everyone is
            Going ‘.<br />
            4) At the university level, the main focus is an academic education having little Focus on hands-on skills.<br />
            5) To Fill the Existing Gap in University Education being Imparted & Community / Industry Needs and Today latest
            Technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain are offering almost “Ready to go “
            Solutions. The Only requirement is to bring all relevant Stakeholders in an Eco-System and on One Page.<br />
            6) The Traditional Cycle of HEC approvals to update the existing course curriculum is Time Consuming and any effort to
            Bring Change through Traditional Channels would delay the Process to the Unmanageable level. The existing Unemployment
            of existing Graduates and the alarming increase in their Numbers need some out of Box Solution on Emergency Grounds.<br />
            7) Digital Transformation is fast changing our Education Systems from School Level to University Levels. Focus now is on
            Skill Based Education STEM System is catching up FAST as a Global Best Practice but in Pakistan, Very few Privileged
            Educational Institutions are offering this.<br />
            8) Traditional Industry Industry-Academia / ORIC arrangements have no more remained compatible with Fast Changing Needs.<br />
            9) Digital Divide between different universities within Pakistan is increasing fast, needs to Minimize.<br />
            10) There are NO linkages between FYPs & Community Needs in Development Sector Like Health, Educational, Agriculture,
            Solar Technologies & Smart Watering, etc..</p>
